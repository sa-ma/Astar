    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run a specific algorithm, use the `main.py` script. For example, to run the Uniform Cost Search (UCS) algorithm:

```sh
python [main.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/1)
